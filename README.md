Wilson

    "Hidee-ho, neighbor"

Wilson is a framework for Node.js, the product of me spending several nights kind of sleeplessly hacking on the idea.

The goal is to bring along the parts of Django that I like, without tightly coupling them --

For instance, one should be able to choose a different (or multiple) router systems, templating systems, orm, etc,
and things should still work at least pretty okay. This is a hindengoal, of course -- it changes upon observation.

Wilson should seem familiar to Djangonauts -- there are equivalents of the various shortcuts, url reversing,
urls.js files that contain routes, apps, models that look (in as much as possible) like Django models, etc.

This is a WIP. 

For an example app and project, [take a look here](http://github.com/chrisdickinson/wilson-example/).

For docs, first of all lower your expectations (and remember that this is a rapidly evolving project), and then look
over at [readthedocs.org](http://readthedocs.org/projects/chrisdickinson/wilson/docs/).
